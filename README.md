## Requirements:

## FAQ:

- **I can't see any LICENSE.md file**

  It's because there isn't one. Consider this statement to be your license: do whatever you want with this code
  
- **Do you have a TypeScript version?**

  No, write your own

- **Why do you use the /pages router and how would I use it in the /app router?**

  Because it's simpler to dump some example code. If you want to use it in the app router, ask ChatGPT how to do it
  
- **What if I don't want it in a modal or conditionally displayed?**

  Ask ChatGPT to clean it up for you
  
- **Where's the rest of the app?**

  There isn't, this is just an example offered for free
  
- **Can I fork this?**

  Please don't. Just copy and paste the code wherever you need it

- **Why did you add a .env file, don't you know that's not safe to store it on Github?**

  It's just an example
